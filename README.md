A simple EDMC plugin to automatically collect codex discovery data for publication by the Intergalactic Astronomical Union and EDAstro.com

Data is posted at: 

(https://github.com/Intergalactic-Astronomical-Union/publications/blob/master/IGAU_Codex.csv.gz) (Monthly)

(https://edastro.com/mapcharts/codex.html) (Weekly)



**NOTE:**

IGAU will no longer update the codex CSV after January 3rd, 2024. ATEL-EDMC is now deprecated. 

Spansh and EDSM provide galaxy dump files, the IGAU Codex CSV is no longer necessary.
